### Functions 
> 1. There are few very common functions like 'type', 'id'.
> 2. type is used as `print(type(first_num))` which tells us about the type of the variable we are using so output will be <class 'int'>.
> 3. id is used as `print(id(firt_num))` which tells us about the memory location of the variable, so output can be like the location 1650078624
> 4. `print(dir(int))` so this will how us all the possible built in functions for the int datatype.

> object interning - when the memory location of both variables are same, just because the value stored in those differetn varibales are same.

### Datatypes 
<pre>
1. Immutable datatypes - as you assign a value and create the object, you can't modify the value stored in it -> int, float, booleans, strings, tuples
2. Mutable datatypes - update, delete, add elements from the same variable or same memory location -> list, dictionary,set
</pre>

### Operators
`AABCILM`

<pre>
  A - Arithmatic : +, -, *, /, //, %, **
  A - Assignment : =, +=, -=, *=, /=
  B - Bitwise : &, |, ^, >>, <<
  C - Comparison : <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
  I - Identity : is, isnot
  L - Logical : and, or, not
  M - Membership : in, not in
</pre>

### Conditional statements
### Loops 
> 1. for loop
> 2. while loop
><br>
> While loop is a loop statement used for the repeated execution of the statements. It is preferred when the loop statement is required and a number of iterations are not defined. In case the condition is not known, it shows an error unlike for loop which will have infinite iterations.

### Strings
> 1. Immutable
> 2. ordered data structure
> 3. slicing
> 4.
